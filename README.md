# Flow-ZipTuple-KT

Ability to zip flows from 3 to 16 arity tuples.

``` kotlin
zipTuple(flow1, flow2, flow3)
    .collectLatest { (a, b, c) ->
        // ...
    }
```

Also allows zipping an arbitrary number of flows into an array.

``` kotlin
zipArray(*flows)
    .collectLatest { array ->
        // ...
    }
```

## Using Flow-ZipTuple-KT

In order to use Flow-ZipTuple-KT, you need to add `jitpack` to your project root `build.gradle.kts`
(or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { setUrl("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
    // ...
}
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
    // ...
}
```

In newer projects, you need to also update the `settings.gradle` file's `dependencyResolutionManagement` block:

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }  // <--
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
```


and then, add the dependency to your module's `build.gradle.kts` (or `build.gradle`):

``` kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
implementation("com.github.Zhuinden:flow-ziptuple-kt:1.2.1")
```

or

``` groovy
// build.gradle
implementation 'com.github.Zhuinden:flow-ziptuple-kt:1.2.1'
```
